## **Gmail** calendars can be integrated with CalDAV
**Gmail** calendars can be integrated with CalDAV, allowing you to sync your Google Calendar with other CalDAV-compatible applications, such as Nextcloud's Calendar app. Here's how to set up CalDAV synchronization with Google Calendar:

### **Setting Up CalDAV Sync with Google Calendar**

#### **For Nextcloud Calendar Integration**

1. **Get the CalDAV URL from Google Calendar:**
   - **On Google Calendar Website:**
     1. Open [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com).
     2. Click on the gear icon (⚙️) and select "Settings."
     3. In the left-hand menu, select "Add calendar" and then "Subscribe to calendar" or "Integrate calendar."
     4. Under "Integrate calendar," locate the "Secret address in iCal format" (ICS URL). **Note:** Google does not directly provide a CalDAV URL but provides an ICS URL for integration.
     5. Copy the ICS URL provided.

2. **Convert the ICS URL to CalDAV URL (if needed):**
   - Google Calendar does not provide a direct CalDAV URL for public calendars. The ICS URL can be used for read-only access or can be synced with applications that support ICS. For full CalDAV access, you would typically use third-party tools or services.

3. **Configure Nextcloud Calendar:**
   - Open the Nextcloud Calendar app.
   - Click on "New Subscription" and paste the ICS URL from Google Calendar.
   - Save and sync. Your Google Calendar events should now appear in your Nextcloud Calendar. Note that this method will offer read-only access, and for full CalDAV functionality, further steps may be required.

#### **For Mobile Devices**

**For iOS (Google Calendar Sync):**
- **Using Google Account Directly:**
  - Open "Settings" on your iPhone or iPad.
  - Go to "Passwords & Accounts" > "Add Account."
  - Select "Google" and sign in with your Google account.
  - Make sure "Calendars" is enabled to sync your Google Calendar.

**For Android (Google Calendar Sync):**
- **Using Google Account Directly:**
  - Open "Settings" on your Android device.
  - Go to "Accounts" > "Add Account" > "Google."
  - Sign in with your Google account.
  - Ensure "Calendar" sync is enabled to sync your Google Calendar.

#### **Using Third-Party CalDAV Sync Apps for Advanced Integration**

If you need full CalDAV support or wish to integrate with applications that require a direct CalDAV URL:

1. **Install a CalDAV sync app** on your device, such as "DAVx⁵" for Android or "CalDAV-Sync" for various devices.
2. **Set up the sync app:**
   - Enter the CalDAV server details, if available, or use the app’s functionality to convert ICS URLs for broader support.
   - Sync your Google Calendar with the CalDAV sync app for more advanced integration and functionality.

### **Conclusion**

Google Calendar integrates well with various calendar applications, but it provides ICS URLs rather than direct CalDAV URLs for most users. For read-only access, you can use the ICS URL with Nextcloud Calendar. For full CalDAV functionality, you may need to use third-party sync apps or tools. Syncing Google Calendar with iOS and Android devices is straightforward via Google account settings, which allows seamless calendar access across devices.
